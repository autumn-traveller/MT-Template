    abstract =  {Replication and Elimination functions of DetNet Architecture can result in out-of-order packets, which is not acceptable for some time-sensitive applications. The Packet Ordering Function (POF) algorithm described herein enables to restore the correct packet order when replication and elimination functions are used in DetNet networks.},
