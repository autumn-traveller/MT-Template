I would like to thank my unofficial advisor Hauke Buhr for his help, advice and support. I also thank my advisor Marius for his insights. Both of them provided excellent constructive feedback to me, for which I am grateful. I am also indebted to the rest team at Fraunhofer FOKUS for all their help, especially Hemant Zope, Eric Troudt, Christian Scheich and Aleksandar Yonchev. Lastly I would like to thank Prof. Dr.-Ing. habil. Falko Dressler and Prof. Dr. Zubow whose courses I enjoyed immensely during my studies, and from whom I learned a lot.
