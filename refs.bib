	abstract = {Fulﬁlling the ambitious Quality of Service demands of today’s wireless networks, especially low latency, high bandwidths and availability, is a big challenge for researchers, network architects, and operators. Each networking component on the data path between the user equipment and the destination data network, e.g., the Internet, must provide the highest performance to meet these requirements. This work demonstrates how different network elements of the user plane, describing the whole path of user trafﬁc, can be sped up with different hardware acceleration technologies. For that, we demonstrate how to build up a 5G standalone campus network for evaluation, working end-to-end with real user equipment and open-source software components. Further, we analyze the user plane network functions of 5G networks from the radio access network to the core. Based on our real 5G setup, the practical evaluation of the analysis results shows up how the 5G user plane hardware can be accelerated best.},

	abstract = {Multihoming is often used by large enterprises and stub {ISPs} to connect to the Internet. In this paper, we design a series of novel smart routing algorithms to optimize cost and performance for multihomed users. We evaluate our algorithms through both analysis and extensive simulations based on realistic charging models, trafﬁc demands, performance data, and network topologies. Our results suggest that these algorithms are very effective in minimizing cost and at the same time improving performance. We further examine the equilibrium performance of smart routing in a global setting and show that a smart routing user can improve its performance without adversely affecting other users.},

	abstract = {Network Functions Virtualization ({NFV}) is a concept that aims at providing network operators with beneﬁts in terms of cost, ﬂexibility, and vendor independence by utilizing virtualization techniques to run network functions as software on commercial off-the-shelf ({COTS}) hardware. In contrast, prior solutions rely on specialized hardware for each function. Performance evaluation of such systems usually requires a dedicated testbed for each individual component. Rather than analyzing these proprietary black-box components, Virtualized Network Functions ({VNFs}) are pieces of software that run on {COTS} hardware and whose properties can be investigated in a generic testbed. However, depending on the underlying hardware, operating system, and implementation, {VNFs} might behave differently. Therefore, mechanisms for the performance evaluation of {VNFs} should be similar to benchmarking of software, where different implementations are compared by applying them to predeﬁned test cases and scenarios. This work presents a ﬁrst step towards a benchmarking framework for {VNFs}. Given two different implementations of a {VNF} that acts as {LTE} Serving Gateway ({SGW}), inﬂuence factors and key performance indicators are identiﬁed and a comparison between the two mechanisms is drawn.},

These multipath protocols are broadly classiﬁed into ﬁve categories based on their major goals. The goals are to improve delay, provide reliability, reduce overhead, maximize network life and support hybrid routing. Multipath routing protocols address issues such as multiple paths discovery and maintaining these paths. Issues, objectives, performances, advantages and disadvantages of these protocols are investigated and summarized. A checklist is provided as a guideline so that a network designer can choose an appropriate multipath routing protocol to meet the network’s application objectives.},

In this paper, we propose yet another multipath routing scheme ({YAMR}) for the interdomain case. {YAMR} provably constructs a set of paths that is resilient to any one inter-domain link failure, thus achieving high reliability in a systematic way. Further, even though {YAMR} maintains more paths than {BGP}, it actually requires signiﬁcantly less control trafﬁc, thus alleviating instead of worsening one of the Internet’s scalability problems. This reduction in churn is achieved by a novel hiding technique that automatically localizes failures leaving the greater part of the Internet completely oblivious.},

Path snitching can potentially address this problem without requiring new network mechanisms, simply hy leveraging the robustness to performance variations available from connectivity options such as multi-homing and overlays. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness and benefits of path switching in improving the quality of {VOW} applications, and demonstrate its feasihility through the design and implementation of a prototype gateway. We argue for an application-driven path switching system that accounts for both network path characteristics and application-specific factors (e.g., codec algorithms, playout buffering schemw)+We also develop an application path quality estimator based on the {ITU}-T E-model for voice quality assessment, and an applicationdriven path switching algorithm that dynamically adapts the time scales over which path switching decisions are made to maximize voice quality. Through network emulation and experiments over a wide-area multi-homed testbed, we show that, with sufficient path diversity, path switching can yield meaningful improvemenb in voice quality. Hence by exploiting the inherent path diversity of the Internet, application-driven path switching is a viable option in providing quality-of-service to applications.},

	title = {A Measurement-Based Analysis of Multihoming},
	abstract = {Multihoming has traditionally been employed by stub networks to enhance the reliability of their network connectivity. With the advent of commercial “intelligent route control” products, stubs now leverage multihoming to improve performance. Although multihoming is widely used for reliability and, increasingly for performance, not much is known about the tangible beneﬁts that multihoming can offer, or how these beneﬁts can be fully exploited. In this paper, we aim to quantify the extent to which multihomed networks can leverage performance and reliability beneﬁts from connections to multiple providers. We use data collected from servers belonging to the Akamai content distribution network to evaluate performance beneﬁts from two distinct perspectives of multihoming: high-volume content-providers which transmit large volumes of data to many distributed clients, and enterprises which primarily receive data from the network. In both cases, we ﬁnd that multihoming can improve performance signiﬁcantly and that not choosing the right set of providers could result in a performance penalty as high as 40\%. We also ﬁnd evidence of diminishing returns in performance when more than four providers are considered for multihoming. In addition, using a large collection of measurements, we provide an analysis of the reliability beneﬁts of multihoming. Finally, we provide guidelines on how multihomed networks can choose {ISPs}, and discuss practical strategies of using multiple upstream connections to achieve optimal performance beneﬁts.},
